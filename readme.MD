# Board

# What this is.

This is a simple exercise I decided to build to explore the [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) pettern, it will printout a squared gameboard composed of small squares with a number at the center (starting from 1) and each of the rows are numbered in reverse order from the previous.

## How to run it.

clone the repo:
`git clone git@github.com:jabawack81/board.rb.git`

then move inside the folder of the repo
`cd board.rb`

then execute the main.rb file with the ruby interpreter
`ruby main.rb`
